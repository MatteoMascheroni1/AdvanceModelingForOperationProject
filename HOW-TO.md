# How to use the script

We decided to divide the script in two main parts:

* `main.py` is the model of the factory and contains all data structures needed to collect data from the simulation
* `utils.py` in this file there are all the functions related to the model like compute charging time, copute energy consumption and so on nd so forth

## Parameters of the simulation
